# sedml

## Installation

```
pip install sedml
```

## Development

We are using pytest for testing,
and pre-commit hooks to format and lint the codebase.

To easily set-up a development environment,
run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/maurosilber/sedml
cd sedml
conda env create --file environment-dev.yml
pre-commit install
```

which assume you have git and conda preinstalled.
